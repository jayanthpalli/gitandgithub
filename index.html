<p style="font-size: 25px;">Git and GitHub are two popular tools used in software development. Git is a distributed version control system that helps track changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows 1. On the other hand, GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service that offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides a graphical user interface for managing Git repositories and includes a built-in user management feature. GitHub is focused on centralized source code hosting and is a hosting service for Git repositories </p>
